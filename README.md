# Workout Tracker

This is a Python program built to track workouts using the Nutritionix API and Google Sheets via the Sheety API. The program allows users to input their daily exercise routine in simple English, such as "I ran 25 km," and it retrieves relevant information from the Nutritionix API, including the exercise name, duration, and calories burnt. This information is then posted to a Google Sheets document for easy tracking and analysis.
